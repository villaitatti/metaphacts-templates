  		<p>The following document explains what data is found in each column of the master spreadsheet holding the transcription of the Florentine Drawings database.</p>
  		<p>The Florentine Drawings database is derived from the three editions (1903, 1938, and 1961) of Bernard Berenson’s book, Drawings of the Florentine Painters. The 1903 and 1938 editions are in English, and the 1961 edition is in Italian. The data has been selectively transcribed; not all information printed in the books is included.</p>
			<p>The definition of what constitutes a drawing is, as it was in Berenson’s book, not always clear-cut. Though often a single sheet, which might have marks on the recto and the verso, a recto and a verso might be cataloged by Berenson or the drawing’s owner as separate works. Additionally, drawings might be part of a complex object such as a sketchbook. Multiple drawings may have been mounted together.</p>

  		<p>The data in the database consists of drawing records created by Berenson. This data was transcribed in summer 2015 in two phases. In phase one, an Excel spreadsheet was created for each artist (about 61% of total records were transcribed in this phase). In phase two, each transcriber was given one Google sheet to work in, and new columns were added in order to ensure multiple data points were not entered in the same field.</p>
  		<p>Because the data was transcribed according to different guidelines in the two phases of transcription, separate data cleanup efforts were conducted. The individual artist spreadsheets from phase one were combined into one. The two spreadsheets created in phase two were combined into one.</p>
			<p>Once each phase’s data was cleaned, the phase one master spreadsheet and the phase two master spreadsheet were combined. Individual drawing identifiers were assigned to each row, using a Python script to add padding zeros.</p>
