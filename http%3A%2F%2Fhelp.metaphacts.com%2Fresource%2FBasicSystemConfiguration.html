  <h1> Basic System Configuration </h1>
  This page describes how to adjust general system behavior via configuration properties. 
  
  <h2> Configuration Properties</h2>
  
  Configuration properties are divided into three so called "configuration groups": 
    
  <ul>
    <li>  Environment Configuration Group </li> 
    <li>  Global Configuration Group </li> 
    <li>  UI Configuration Group </li> 
  </ul>
  <p>
  	Properties in these groups might be shadowed via JVM runtime parameters, for example, depending on the deployment mode one may particular supply environment specific groups via JVM runtime parameters. 
  	This can by done by supplying <span class="inline-code">"-Dconfig.{configGroup}.{propertyName}={propertyValue}"</span>, 
  	where "configGroup"" is the identifier of the configuration (either "environment", "global", or "ui" for the three groups, respectively) and "propertyName" is the name of the property in the given group.
  	Shadowed parameters can not be overwritten or changed during runtime.
  </p>

  <h3>Environment Configuration Group </h3>
  
  	The environment group (file "config/environment.prop") contains all deployment-specific configuration options such as server URLs, keys, etc. 
    These parameters may influence how the platform is initialized and as such they can not be change during runtime, for example, through the &nbsp;<semantic-link uri="http://www.metaphacts.com/resource/admin/Configuration" title="Configuration">configuration UI</semantic-link>.

        </tr>
      </tbody>
  	</table>
  

  <h2> Security </h2>
  The platform relies on the <a href="http://shiro.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Shiro</a> security framework. 
  While it is possible to hook-in different security providers and realms, the easiest way is to define users, roles and permissions using the "shiro.ini" file. <br/>

  New user accounts should be created using the respective &nbsp;<semantic-link uri="http://www.metaphacts.com/resource/admin/Security" title="Security">administration page </semantic-link>. The same widget can be used to modify accounts and to re-assign existing roles to users. However, creating new roles and permissions need to be done by modifying the shiro.ini manually (c.f. Basic ACLs section at the bottom of the page). <br/>

  <bs-alert bs-style="info"><strong>Please Note:</strong><br/>
  If no shiro.ini file is configured, the platform will use a a pre-bundled shiro.ini file with default logins and a warning will be printed in the startup logs.
	</bs-alert>
  <h3> Login Protection </h3>
  By default the platform requires authentication for all resources below the root /** URL. <br/>
  For security reasons it is not possible to disable authentication entirely, 
  however, one can grant access to anonymous/guest user by enabling a special "anon" authentication filter (c.f. general system properties section).

  To activate the filter, the following configuration property needs to be set in environment.prop
  <div class="highlight" style="margin-left:2%"><pre>
  shiroAuthenticationFilter=authcBasic,anon,authc
  </pre></div>

  <bs-alert bs-style="info"><strong>Please Note:</strong><br/>
     For the special anonymous filter ("anon") a static user with the user principal <b>"anonymous"</b> (and any dummy password) must be configured 
     i.e. must granted access to the respective resource and operations by assigning the respective roles (c.f. Basic ACLs section below).
	</bs-alert>
  <h3> Basic ACLs </h3>
  For the time being fine fine-granular permissions can only be granted to the SPARQL endpoint, RDF Graph Store, Account service  and the Template service.
  Permissions are <b>whitelist based</b> i.e. one needs to assign permissions explicitly.

  Permissions:

  <b>Example Configuration:</b><br/>
  The example below defines two users with salt-encrypted passwords (c.f. <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/command-line-hasher.html" target="_blank">Shiro Command Line Hasher</a>) and assigns roles to them. Permissions are granted to roles in the <i>[roles]</i> section.<br/>
  <ul>
  <li>The role "rootRole" is granted permission to view, create and modify accounts.</li>
  <li>The role "adminRole" is granted permission to execute all SPARQL query and update operations as well as to save template pages .</li>
  <li>The role "guestRole" is granted permission to execute all SPARQL query operations, but no update operations.  In addition, the "guestRole" can not save template pages.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="highlight" style="margin-left:2%"><pre>
  [users]
  admin=$shiro1$SHA-256$500000$JWFyxDbrkcdlGl6Xpj02dg==$UYbUG3bHmT8Z4dTeEHToK5WdyvwR9cRefiM/9zRjfr4=,adminRole,rootRole

  It is <b>strongly recommended</b> to only change the <i>[roles]</i> section by hand and to do these changes not during runtime.<br/>
